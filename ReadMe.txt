This simulates a game of monopoly being played by two users. It was written as an assignment as a second year student. 
The project makes use of key programming techniques such as polymorphishm and other object oriented methods. 
The rules the game follows can be seen in the .docX file.

This was built using the TL-Engine, an in house engine created by the teaching staff at the University of Central Lancashire. 
I have therefore only included the files that were written by me as an example of work. 

If available, a link to a video demonstrating the project can be found in another text file located in the repositary.
